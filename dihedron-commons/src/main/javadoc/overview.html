  	<h2>1. Abstract</h2>
    <p>    
    The <b>Commons</b> library is a small collection of utility classes; they
    provide basic functionalities ranging from simple static methods to test
    string validity to more complex reflection-based classes.
    </p>
    <h2>2. Description</h2>
    <p>
    The Commons library implements a set of functionalities:<ol>
    <li>a String function library, providing simple method to perform a set
    of repetitive operations on strings (such as testing in one shot if a string 
    is non-null and not empty)</li>
    <li>a Regex class implementing in a more compact way the basic operations on 
    regular expressions</li>
    <li>a resource class, providing method to retrieve a resource as a stream 
    from the current classloader</li>
    <li>an XML DOM helper class, complementing the basic DOM navigation methods 
    with other utility method, to provide better tools for the task of
    interpreting an XML document</li>
    <li>a Reflector class, providing a set of object introspection capabilities
    aimed at making meta-programming easier and less verbose.</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
	Most other Dihedron libraries and application depend on this library.
