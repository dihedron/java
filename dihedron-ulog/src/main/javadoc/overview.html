    <p>
    The <b>uLog</b> library is a minimalistic library for logging; it leverages the
    thread-local storage to achieve very good performance. Tests show that its edge over 
    LOG4J increases with the number of concurrent threads active in the JVM: while LOG4J gets
    slower and slower due to synchronisation issues, uLog's timings stay flat.
